# Improving Spoken Presentation on the Web

## What is this?

This is a proposal for a mechanism to allow content authors to include spoken presentation
guidance in HTML content.  Such guidance can be used by assistive technologies (including screen readers and read aloud tools) and voice assistants to control text to speech synthesis in order
to ensure the spoken content matches the authored intent/expectations.

This proposal has emerged from the work of the Accessible Platform Architecture Pronunciation
Task Force and presents a juncture at which the two proposed approaches vary significantly
in terms of authoring and consumption.

## Why do we care?

Several classes of assistive technology users depend upon spoken rendering of web content by
text to speech synthesis (TTS).  In contexts such as education, there are specific requirements for
accuracy of spoken presentation in terms of pronunciation, emphasis, prosody, pausing, etc.
