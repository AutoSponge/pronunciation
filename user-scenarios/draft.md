# Introduction

As part of the Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group, the Pronunciation Task Force is a collaboration of subject matter experts working to identify and specify the optimal approach which can deliver reliably accurate pronunciation across browser and operating environments. With the introduction of the Kurzweil reading aid in 1976, to the more sophisticated synthetic speech currently used to assist communication as reading aides for the visually impaired and those with reading disabilities, the technology has multiple applications in education, communication, entertainment, etc. From helping to teach spelling and pronunciation in different languages, Text-to-Speech (TTS) has become a vital technology for providing access to digital content on the web and through mobile devices.

The challenges that TTS introduces is the inability to accommodate regional variations and presentation of every phoneme present throughout the world. A number of markup languages have been established to address these language and pronunciation variations and make the content legible and meaningful.  The W3c recommendation, of the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), provides a promising approach that will be addressed through the Pronunciation Task Force. This document explores requirements based on examples of use cases and scenarios.

## User Scenarios

### Educational Assessment

As a test administrator, I want to ensure that students with the read aloud accommodation who are using assistive technology or speech synthesis as an alternative to a human reader, have the same speech quality (e.g., intonation, expression, pronunciation, and pace, etc.) as spoken language.

As a test administrator, speech accuracy with mathematical expressions, including numbers, fractions, and operations can be difficult to pronounce. Some mathematical expressions required special pronunciations to prevent any violations to the test construct.

As a test administrator/educator, pronunciations must be consistent across instruction and assessment, in order to avoid test bias or impact effects for students.

As a test taker (tester) with a visual impairment who may use assistive technology to access the test content with speech software, screen reader or refreshable braille device, I want the content to be presented as intended, with accurate pronunciation and articulation, so that my assessment accurately reflects my knowledge of the content.

### Education Publishing

As a content developer, I want to create content that can readily be delivered both assistive technology and can convey the correct meaning and ensure that screen readers render the right pronunciation based on the surrounding context.

### Academic Research

**Contributed by:** Paul Grenier on behalf of [Léamh](https://léamh.org/).

**Description:** An academic resource for translation of Irish texts (13th - 18th century) supported by several universities. With pronunciation standards for the web, anthropological linguistics scholars could join the conversation and possibly offer new insights to this academic work. Hearing Early Modern Irish spoken may spark more interest among students to assist with the translations of texts. Many of the studied works were once performed. As linguists map phonemes to synthesized voices, Pronunciation standards can help bring this language "back to life" for historians and Arts programs. Additionally, blind and low vision scholars, unable to read the texts, could assist with additional translations.

### Cultural Exchange

**Contributed by:** Paul Grenier on behalf of [Pronounce Names](https://www.pronouncenames.com/).

**Description:** A free resource assisting with proper name pronunciation. Currently, users of the site must be familiar with English alphabet pronunciation (romaji when used for Japanese). Linguists providing pronunciation could increase accuracy and expand to languages the English alphabet can not pronounce if it were accessible to users. With Pronunciation standards, users of Pronounce Names could use the browser's Speech Synthesis to speak names using the IPA alphabet.

A person requesting pronunciation for their own name, could use the browser's Speech Synthesis to verify their preferred pronunciation. This could be copied to resumes, social media, vcard, business cards, etc. In the case of "Americanized" names, personal choice is more important than correctness and many alternate pronunciations may exist. For example, the surname "Grenier" has two pronunciations on the site, and my prefered pronunciation is neither of them.
