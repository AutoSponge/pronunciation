				The objective of the Pronunciation Task Force is to develop normative
				specifications and best practices guidance collaborating with other W3C
				groups as appropriate, to provide for proper pronunciation in HTML
				content when using text to speech (TTS) synthesis. This document defines
				a standard mechanism to allow content authors to include spoken
				presentation guidance in HTML content. Also, it contains two identified
				approaches and enumerates their advantages and disadvantages.

			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>
				This is a proposal for a mechanism to allow content authors to include
				spoken presentation guidance in HTML content. Such guidance can be used
				by assistive technologies (including screen readers and read aloud
				tools) and voice assistants to enhance and control text to speech synthesis. A key
				requirement is to ensure the spoken presentation content matches the
				author's intent and user expectations.</p>

				<p>Currently, the
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/">W3C SSML standard</a>
				is seen as an important piece of a solution. The challenge is how to
				integrate SSML into HTML that is both easy to author, does not "break"
				content, and is straightforward for consumption by assistive
				technologies, voice assistants, and other tools that produce spoken
				presentation of content.</p>>
                <p>
				This proposal has emerged from the work of the Accessible Platform
				Architecture Pronunciation Task Force and represents a decision point
				arising from two differing approaches for integrating SSML (or SSML-like
				characteristics) into HTML. The core approach is the proposed addition of one or more attributes
				to HTML elements in a concise manner to enable consumption by user agents, extensions, or external tools
				which transform content into a spoken form using text to speech synthesis. Two models of attribute
				usage have emerged:</p>
				<ul><li>a multi-attribute approach, comprising one or more attributes which can be
				added to an element to convey SSML functions and properties.</li>
			<li>a single attribute approach, in which the attribute value is a JSON string containing 
				one more property value pairs conveying SSML functions and properties.
			</li>
		</ul>
			<p>Each of the approaches is specified in the following sections, and includes example code.
			</p>

				><a class="self-link" href="#inline-ssml"></a>
			</h2>
<p> For
	example, the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-spec.html">EPUB3</a>
	standard includes the SSML phoneme element implemented as a pair of
	namespaced attributes and is used by publishers in Japan.</p>
			<p>TBD</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 class="heading settled" data-level="2" id="single-attribute-ssml">
				<span class="secno">2. </span
				><span class="content">Single-attribute Approach for Including SSML in HTML</span
				><a class="self-link" href="#attribute-ssml"></a>
			</h2>

			<p>
				The single attribute approach utilizes a JSON structure to allow defition of SSML compatible
				properties to be applied to textual content in HTML. Advantages include the current uses of variants of the attribute model
				are currently used by educational assessment vendors, these variants are
				supported by custom read aloud tools, and it appears that the attribute
				model may be more easily implementable by screen reader vendors.
			</p>
			<p>
			 This approach
				requires transforming the attribute content represented in JSON into
				SSML by the consumer (screen reader, read aloud tool, voice assistant,
				etc.). Possible security concerns exist with the JSON approach. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No other standard uses string JSON values for attributes in
				HTML. This may cause problems for implementers who must parse the JSON
				values before processing. The browser, which normally attempts to
				address malformed HTML, can make no guarantees about the JSON strings.
				Implementers must decide how to handle malformed JSON.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the schema for `data-ssml` values has not been set. Competing
				standards for this format, like
				<a href="https://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification"
					>SpeakableSpecification</a
				>, as well as any issues converting SSML to a proper JSON schema could
				cause confusion for implementors and authors. Often such conversions are
				"...not exactly 1:1 transformation, but very very close".
			</p>
			<p>
				A simple example of the single attribute based model of SSML is shown below:
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>
					According the 2010 US Census, the population of &lt;span
					data-ssml='{&quot;say-as&quot; :
					{&quot;interpret-as&quot;:&quot;digits&quot;}}'&gt;90274&lt;/span&gt;
					increased to 25209 from 24976 over the past 10 years.
				</p>
			</div>
			<section>
				<h3>SSML properties and values</h3>
				<p>
					The following properties are defined and provide functional equivalence to the their SSML counterpart.
				</p>
				<section>
					<h4><code>say-as</code></h4>
					<p>
						The say-as property allows the author to indicate information on the type of text construct contained within the element and to help specify the level of detail for rendering the contained text.	There are 
						three child property value pairs.
					</p>
					<h5>interpret-as</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>format</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>detail (optional)</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<p>
						A simple example of the say-as is shown below
					</p>
					<div class="example"><code>
							According the 2010 US Census, the population of &lt;span
							data-ssml='{&quot;say-as&quot; :
							{&quot;interpret-as&quot;:&quot;digits&quot;}}'&gt;90274&lt;/span&gt;
							increased to 25209 from 24976 over the past 10 years.
						</code>
					</div>


				</section>
				<section>
					<h4><code>phoneme</code></h4>
					<p>
						The phoneme property provides a phonemic/phonetic pronunciation for the contained text. 	There are 
						there are two child property value pairs.  The element on which the phoneme property is applied itself can only contain text (no elements).
					</p>
					<h5>ph</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>alphabet</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<p>
						A simple example of the phoneme is shown below
					</p>
					<div class="example">
						<code>
							Once upon a midnight &lt;span data-ssml='{"phoneme":{"alphabet":"ipa";ph:"ˈdrɪəri"}}'&gt;dreary&lt;/span&gt;
						</code>
					</div>

				
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4><code>sub</code></h4>
					<p>
						The sub property is employed to indicate that the text in the alias attribute value replaces the contained text for pronunciation. This allows a document to contain both a spoken and written form. The required alias attribute specifies the string to be spoken instead of the enclosed string. The processor should apply text normalization to the alias value.
						There is one child property attribute pair.
					</p>
					<h5>alias</h5>
					<p>Specifies the string to be spoken instead of the enclosed stringt</p>
					<p>
						A simple example of the sub is shown below
					</p>
					<div class="example">
						<code>
							&lt;span data-ssml='{"sub":{"alias":"Sodium Chloride"}}'&gt;NaCL&lt;/span&gt;
						</code>
					</div>

				
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4><code>voice</code></h4>
					<p>
						The voice property is a production element that requests a change in speaking voice. There are two kinds of attributes for the voice element: those that indicate desired features of a voice and those that control behavior. 
						The voice property child properties are:
					</p>
					<h5>gender (optional)</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>age (optional)</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>variant (optional)</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>name (optional)</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>langauge (optional)</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<p>
						A simple example of the vocie is shown below
					</p>
					<div class="example">
						<code>
							She said, "&lt;span data-ssml='{"voice":{"gender":"female"}}'&gt;My name is Marie&lt;/span&gt;".
						</code>
					</div>

				
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4><code>emphasis</code></h4>
					<p>
						The emphasis property requests that the contained text be spoken with emphasis (also referred to as prominence or stress).  There is a single child property value pair.

					</p>
					<h5>level</h5>
					<p>The possible values are:</p>
					<ul><li>strong</li><li>moderate</li></ul><li>none</li><li>reduced</li></ul>

					<p>
						A simple example of the emphasis is shown below
					</p>
					<div class="example">
						<code>
							Please use &lt;span data-ssml='{"emphasis":{"level":"strong"}}'&gt;extreme caution.&lt;/span&gt;
						</code>
					</div>

				
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4><code>break</code></h4>
					<p>
						The break element is an empty element that controls the pausing or other prosodic boundaries between tokens. The use of the break element between any pair of tokens is optional. If the element is not present between tokens, the synthesis processor is expected to automatically determine a break based on the linguistic context.

					</p>
					<h5>strength</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>time</h5>
					<p>time duration expressed in numeric form as "250ms", "1s", etc.</p>
					<p>
						A simple example of the break is shown below
					</p>
					<div class="example">
						<code>
							Take a deep breath,&lt;span data-ssml='{"break":{"time":"1s"}}'&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and exhale.
						</code>
					</div>

				
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4><code>prosody</code></h4>
					<p>
						The prosody property permits control of the pitch, speaking rate and volume of the speech output. The child property value pairs, all optional, are:
					</p>
					<h5>pitch</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>contour</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>range</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>rate</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>duration</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>volume</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<p>
						A simple example of the prosody is shown below
					</p>
					<div class="example">
						<code>
							The tortoise, said (slowly) "&lt;span data-ssml='{"prosody":{"rate":"x-slow"}}'&gt;I am almost at the finish line&lt;/span&gt;.""
						</code>
					</div>

				
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4><code>audio</code></h4>
					<p>
						The audio property supports the insertion of recorded audio files and the insertion of other audio formats in conjunction with synthesized speech output.
						 The element to which the audio property is applied may be empty. If the  element is not empty then the contents should be the marked-up text to be spoken if the audio document is not available. 
						 In addition to the optional child property values attributes described  below, audio has the following child property value pairs:

					</p>
					<h5>src</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>fetchtimeout</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>fetchint</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>maxage</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>maxstale</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>clipBegin</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>clipEnd</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>repeatCount</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<h5>repeatDur</h5>
					<p>value list</p>
					<p>
						A simple example of the audio is shown below
					</p>
					<div class="example">
						<code>
							You will hear a brief chime &lt;span data-ssml='{"audio":{"src":"/audio/chime.ogg"}}'&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when your time is up.
						</code>
