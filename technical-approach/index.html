				The objective of the Pronunciation Task Force is to develop normative
				specifications and best practices guidance collaborating with other W3C
				groups as appropriate, to provide for proper pronunciation in HTML
				content when using text to speech (TTS) synthesis. This document defines
				a standard mechanism to allow content authors to include spoken
				presentation guidance in HTML content. Also, it contains two identified
				approaches and enumerates their advantages and disadvantages.

			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>
				This is a proposal for a mechanism to allow content authors to include
				spoken presentation guidance in HTML content. Such guidance can be used
				by assistive technologies (including screen readers and read aloud
				tools) and voice assistants to control text to speech synthesis. A key
				requirement is to ensure the spoken presentation content matches the
				author's intent and user expectations.<br /><br />

				Currently, the
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/">W3C SSML standard</a>
				is seen as an important piece of a solution. The challenge is how to
				integrate SSML into HTML that is both easy to author, does not "break"
				content, and is straightforward for consumption by assistive
				technologies, voice assistants, and other tools that produce spoken
				presentation of content.<br /><br />

				This proposal has emerged from the work of the Accessible Platform
				Architecture Pronunciation Task Force and represents a decision point
				arising from two differing approaches for integrating SSML (or SSML-like
				characteristics) into HTML. Each of the approaches differs in authoring
				and consumption models (specifically for assistive technologies).

				<span class="secno">1. </span><span class="content">In-line SSML</span
				><a class="self-link" href="#inline-ssml"></a>
			</h2>

			<p>
				Advantages including the existence of SSML standard that is directly
				consumable by many speech synthesizers, and the precedent for in-lining
				non-HTML markup such as
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/">SVG</a> and
				<a href="https://w3c.github.io/mathml/">MathML</a>. Also, this approach
				may be more easily consumed by voice-command devices like the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_speaker">smart speaker</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A key disadvantage is that inline SSML appears to be more difficult for
				assistive technologies to implement, specifically for screen readers.
			</p>
			<p>
				A simple example of in-line SSML in an HTML fragment is shown below:
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>
					According the 2010 US Census, the population of
					&lt;speak&gt;&lt;say-as
					interpret-as=&quot;digits&quot;&gt;90274&lt;/say-as&gt;&lt;/speak&gt;
					increased to 25209 from 24976 over the past 10 years.
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 class="heading settled" data-level="2" id="attribute-ssml">
				<span class="secno">2. </span
				><span class="content">Attribute-based Model of SSML</span
				><a class="self-link" href="#attribute-ssml"></a>
			</h2>

			<p>
				Advantages include the current uses of variants of the attribute model
				are currently used by educational assessment vendors, these variants are
				supported by custom read aloud tools, and it appears that the attribute
				model may be more easily implementable by screen reader vendors. For
				example, the
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-spec.html">EPUB3</a>
				standard includes the SSML phoneme element implemented as a pair of
				namespaced attributes and is used by publishers in Japan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Disadvantages may include challenges resulting from the use of JSON. The
				introduction of JSON may add a level of complexity to authoring.
				However, this could be mitigated by authoring tools. This approach
				requires transforming the attribute content represented in JSON into
				SSML by the consumer (screen reader, read aloud tool, voice assistant,
				etc.). Possible security concerns exist with the JSON approach. The EPUB
				approach would lead to a large number of attributes if all the SSML
				elements were to be implemented in that manner.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, no other standard uses string JSON values for attributes in
				HTML. This may cause problems for implementers who must parse the JSON
				values before processing. The browser, which normally attempts to
				address malformed HTML, can make no guarantees about the JSON strings.
				Implementers must decide how to handle malformed JSON.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the schema for `data-ssml` values has not been set. Competing
				standards for this format, like
				<a href="https://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification"
					>SpeakableSpecification</a
				>, as well as any issues converting SSML to a proper JSON schema could
				cause confusion for implementors and authors. Often such conversions are
				"...not exactly 1:1 transformation, but very very close".
			</p>
			<p>
				A simple example of the attribute based model of SSML is shown below:
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>
					According the 2010 US Census, the population of &lt;span
					data-ssml='{&quot;say-as&quot; :
					{&quot;interpret-as&quot;:&quot;digits&quot;}}'&gt;90274&lt;/span&gt;
					increased to 25209 from 24976 over the past 10 years.
