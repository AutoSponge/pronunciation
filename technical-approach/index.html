			<h1>Introduction</h1>
     
            <p>This is a proposal for a mechanism to allow content authors to include spoken presentation guidance in HTML content. Such guidance can be used by assistive technologies (including screen readers and read aloud tools) and voice assistants to control text to speech synthesis. A key requirement is to ensure the spoken presentation content matches the author's intent and user expectations.<br><br>

Currently, the W3C SSML standard is seen as an important piece of a solution. The challenge is how to integrate SSML into HTML that is both easy to author, does not "break" content, and is straightforward for consumption by assistive technologies, voice assistants, and other tools that produce spoken presentation of content.<br><br>

This proposal has emerged from the work of the Accessible Platform Architecture Pronunciation Task Force and represents a decision point arising from two differing approaches for integrating SSML (or SSML-like characteristics) into HTML. Each of the approaches differs in authoring and consumption models (specifically for assistive technologies).</p>
